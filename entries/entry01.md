## Motivation

Me and my partner Dorwin Liang enjoys playing videogames. Although we enjoy playing videogames, we also want to enjoy what goes into making a videogame. We have decided to make a mobile game using Unity.
The game will have singleplayer and multiplayer modes where players can choose a team size from 2-4 other players in matchmaking and can queue up with a friend.

## Problem

Me and my partner want to create a multiplayer survival game as we want something that can be ran on a phone with mid tier performance. We also want a game where you can progress without forcing users to pay for in app purchases and can be played offline with single player mode as a time killer.

## Knowledege Needed

Unity uses C# for scripting, so we need to learn the syntax of this language. It is a object-oriented language, which is the same paradigm as Java, a language we are learning in class. We also might need to learn some shader programming to make the game look more appealing
